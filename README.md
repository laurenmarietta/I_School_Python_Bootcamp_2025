Hello MIMS c/o 2027 and PhDs c/o ~2031! Welcome to the pre-semester Python bootcamp. This bootcamp is intended for students with little to no background in Python programming. Those with more experience are welcome to join, but should be aware that the design of the course is built for beginners. This boot camp is specifically intended to prepare students for [Info 206A](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/206a) and [Info 206B](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/206b).

<h4 align="center">
Code will be located in this repository; lesson slide decks and recordings can be found on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ralrphUVpa88OxQ5iLzgx4TbY9AFIoE_?usp=share_link">Google Drive.</a>

## Goals:
- ‚úèÔ∏è Preparation for INFO 206A & 206B
- üí™üèΩ Building confidence with coding!
- üêç Introducing basics of coding using Python and Jupyter notebooks
- üêæ Learning critical skills and identifying helpful resources for coding in the wild (e.g. debugging, self-teaching, cheatsheets)

## Expectations:
Assignments will not be graded in this course, nor will there be any homework - it is a voluntary class for students who wish to strengthen their programming and Python skills before the semester begins. However, students are encouraged to follow these general rules of conduct to maximize their learning: 
- üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ask questions! A major benefit of the bootcamp is the smaller class size and direct availability of the instructor. Ask ask ask!
- üó£Ô∏è Participate in class discussions. We encourage students to speak at least 1-2 times per class!
- ü§ì Attend classes live. We specifically scheduled the session to  accommodate as many students' schedules as possible! Please let the instructor know if you need to miss classes. If you do need to miss a lesson, materials will be provided for you that you are encouraged to review in your own time.

## Class structure

Each day will follow this typical schedule (ish):

| Time             | Lesson Section |
|------------------|----------------|
| 10:00 - 10:15 am | Check-in       |
| 10:15 - 10:45 am | Lesson Lecture |
| 10:45 - 11:30 am | Lab            |
| 11:30 - 11:40 am | Break          |
| 11:40 - 12:00 pm | Lesson Lecture |
| 12:00 - 12:55 pm | Lab            |
| 12:55 - 13:00 pm | Exit Quiz      |

### Asynchronous Participation
All lessons will be recorded and made available to registered students.

### Labs
Students will work in small groups to complete labs which guide them through the exploration of a topic. Labs will focus on open-ended computational problem-solving where students will go through the process of defining a problem, writing pseudocode to solve that problem, translating that pseudocode to Python code, and testing and debugging that code. In most situations, students will not be expected to finish all parts of a lab, but instead will work through as much of the lab as they can (and can continue working on the lab after the session ends).

### Check-In Quizzes
At the end of each day, students will complete a check-in quiz to help them reflect on the concepts and skills covered that day and to check their understanding of the material. Quiz results will be used to determine what content should be reviewed at the beginning of the following day, as well as to collect feedback on the progression of the bootcamp.

[//]: # (### Project)

[//]: # (Students will spend 2-3 days completing a group coding mini-project that draws on the Python concepts they learned in the bootcamp. For this project, students will )

[//]: # (<!--create a short animation using the Python turtle package that can be transformed into a GIF. The nature of this project will require students to demonstrate their understanding of decomposition and abstraction in order to effectively and efficiently create an animation. Additionally, though this project will not be formally assessed, students will be provided with a list of suggested Python constructs to include in their project. -->)

[//]: # (After completing their projects, students will share their works with their peers in a virtual showcase on the bootcamp's final day.)

### Getting Help
During class sessions, students are encouraged to first seek out their groupmates when they are stuck or confused. Additionally, the instructor will be available to small groups to answer questions and provide problem solving guidance. If needed, a virtual help queue can be provided via Slack so that groups can sign up for support. At the end of each lab, the entire class will gather to discuss common confusions and bugs.

### Office Hours
Office hours will be held each class day, at a time TBD. During this time, students can attend to ask questions, review topics, and get support on their projects or unfinished sections of labs.
